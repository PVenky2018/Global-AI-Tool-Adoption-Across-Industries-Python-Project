# Global-AI-Tool-Adoption-Across-Industries-Python-Project

This project analysed the adoption patterns of AI tools across countries, industries, company sizes, and user demographics using Python-based exploratory analysis and dashboard creation. The dataset spanned two years (2023–2024) and included over 145,000 records capturing global AI usage trends. 

## Dataset Overview
The dataset included the following key fields:
•	Country, Industry, Company Size, User Age Group
•	AI Tool Used, Adoption Rate (%), Daily Active Users
•	Year (2023 & 2024)

## Key Analyses Performed
1. Total Record Count: Determined the total number of data entries to validate dataset size and ensure robust analysis.
2. Global Average AI Adoption: Calculated the average AI adoption rate globally, providing a benchmark for tool uptake across regions.
3. Top AI Tool by Usage: Identified ChatGPT as the tool with the highest average daily active users, establishing its dominance in the market.
4. Most Active Country per AI Tool: Mapped each AI tool to the country with the highest usage, revealing regional preferences (e.g., Bard in India, Claude in France).
5. Top Country by Adoption Rate: Highlighted Singapore as the country with the highest average AI adoption rate, signaling advanced digital maturity.
6. Top-Adopting Industry: Found the Technology sector to have the highest AI adoption, consistent with its innovation-driven nature.
7. Tool Preference by Industry: Analysed which AI tool was most used in each industry (e.g., Claude in Legal, DALL·E in Design), aligning tool strengths with industry needs.
8. Adoption Change Over Time (2023 vs 2024): Tracked year-over-year growth in adoption, showing positive trends for tools like Gemini and ChatGPT.
9. Fastest Growing Countries: Identified India, Brazil, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Mexico as the top 5 countries with the fastest AI adoption growth.
10. Adoption by Company Size: Compared adoption rates across Startups, SMEs, and Enterprises, finding that Enterprises had the highest average adoption.
11. Age Group Usage Analysis: Highlighted the 25–34 age group as the most active in AI tool usage, reflecting young professionals’ affinity for AI integration.
12. Company Size Distribution: Showed that SMEs made up the largest proportion of AI adopters, indicating widespread accessibility of AI tools.
13. AI Tools with Rising Adoption: Identified fast-growing tools over time such as Gemini and Claude, highlighting their increasing market relevance.
14. Lagging Countries: Flagged regions with low AI adoption (e.g., parts of Africa and Eastern Europe), showing the digital divide across economies.
15. SME vs Enterprise Comparison: Found that while Enterprises lead in adoption, SMEs are catching up fast, showing a more dynamic rate of growth.
